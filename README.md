# CCSExampleNPMModule
Example NPM module for build pipe line that allows access to AppConfig information from environment variables.

This is a minimal implementation to allow a simple build pipe line to be created and the resulting npm package
to be referenced by another project, in this case app1 in the CCSExampleApp1 repository.
